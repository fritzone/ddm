<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; background: white; line-height: 115%"> <span id="myfont"> DDM
  is a unique tool for getting into control in the database creation
  and initial setup process by helping professionals to have consistent
  database layouts and delivery between projects, sites and versions.<BR>

<P STYLE="background: white"><span id="myfont">At
  the startup screen you have the following choices:<BR>
  <BR>
Create
  a <B>New
  Solution<BR>
  <BR>
  </B>When
  working with DDM, all your work (i.e. Data Types, Tables, Diagrams,
  ...) is collected into a Project, which in itself is contained in a
  Solution. By clicking this button you will create a new, empty
  solution and an associated project with the possibilty to import a
  predefined set of data types for the chosen database.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Open </B>an
  existing solution<BR>
  <BR>
This will load a solution that you have
  created in the past, and you can continue your work on it.<br>
  <br>
Create a <strong>New Connection</strong><br>
<br>
DDM has a builtin connection manager, and it stores the connection so that you dont have to type them in every time you need to connect to a database. With this button you can create a new connection. For a detailed description of the connections please see <a href="conn.html">this</a>.<br>
<br> 
You can close the startup screen using the &quot;<em>Esc</em>&quot; button.<br>
<br>
Note: From version<em> 0.1g</em> DDM offers the possibilty to browse your connections. For more about this please read <a href="brows.html">this</a> document.</span><br>

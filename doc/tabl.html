<FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In a relational database a table is a set of data, organized in a model using horizontal rows and vertical columns. The columns are identified by a name, and the rows are identified by the values appearing in the columns belonging to the rows key elements. The table can have a specific number of columns and an unlimited number of rows. DDM allows you to create tables using the Data types yo have defined acting as the types for columns, and also allows you to set up relationships between various tables, which can be later presented in a diagram.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt" COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><B>Table Name:</B>Give a unique name for the table type. A small advice is to follow some consistent notation among your tables. <br>

<em>Columns list</em><br>
<br>
The list of columns contains all the columns you have created for this table. The PK field has a <img src="key.png" alt="key" width="16" height="16"> icon in case this is a primary key. By clicking on a column in the list you select the column, and you can modify the name, type or other properties of it.<br>
<br>
By clicking the <img src="up.png" alt="up" width="16" height="16"> button you move the selected column &quot;Up&quot; in the list(ie. to the left in the tables columns), and by clicking the <img src="down.png" alt="down" width="16" height="16"> button you move the selected column &quot;Down&quot; (ie. to the rght in the tables columns). By clicking the <img src="remove.png" alt="remove" width="16" height="16"> button you delete the selected column from the list (and from the table). In case this is a specialized table, the columns from the parent table will be shown with a light gray background and you cannot modify or delete them, nor can you change their position.<br>
<br>
<em>New Column<br>
<br>
</em><B>Name: </B>Give a unique name in this table for the new column.<br>
<br>
<B>Type: </B>Choose the type of the column from the list of Data types you have created.<br>
<br>
<B>Primary key:</B> If you want your column to take part from a list of primary key columns, check this checkbox.<br>
<br>
<B>Auto increment: </B>The incrementation of Numeric types can be taken care automatically by the MySQL database, however this is ignored for non numeric types.<br>
<br>
<B>Description: </B>Give a meaningful description for the column, as this text will appear in the generated code in form of comments and in the generated documentation too.<br>
<br>
When you have filled up the required fields to create a column press the <img src="add.png" alt="add" width="16" height="16"> button to add the new column to the table. If you have a column already selected the <img src="add.png" alt="add" width="16" height="16"> button will be replaced by the <img src="apply.png" alt="apply" width="16" height="16"> button and pressing it will update the column in the table. By pressing the <img src="cancel.png" alt="cancel" width="16" height="16"> button you will reset the changes you have done and can start over again. No changes will be saved to the selected column.<br>

  <br>
This list contains the indices that were created for the table. By clicking on an index you select it, and you can modify its properties. You also can delete the selected index with the <img src="remove.png" alt="remove" width="16" height="16"> button. The indices starting with "autodix_" are indices that were created because of a foreign key referencing this table and should not be deleted nor modified. These indices are having a dark grey background. In case this table is a spcialized table, the indices from the parent table are presented on a light gray background.<br><br>
<em>New Index group.</em><br><br>
<B>Name: </B>is the name of the index.<br>
<br>
<B>Type: </B>you can define the type of the index depending on the Storage Engine and the capabilities of the database.<br>
<br>
<B>Columns:</B> the available columns for the index are on the left side, you can use the <img src="right.png" alt="right" width="16" height="16"> button to move the selected columnto the right (and you can use the <img src="left.png" alt="left" width="16" height="16"> button to remove the selected column from the index). Once a column has been moved to the right side (meaning it was added to the index) you can move them up/down with the <img src="up.png" alt="up" width="16" height="16">/<img src="down.png" alt="down" width="16" height="16"> buttons.<br>
  <br>
When done press the <img src="add.png" alt="add" width="16" height="16"> button to add the new index to the table. Pressing the <img src="cancel.png" alt="cancel" width="16" height="16"> button you will cancel editing the current index.</FONT></P>

In case the selected storage engine for the table does not support foreign keys you will see a warning regarding this. For MySQL right now the InnoDB storage engine has support for foreign keys. In case the selected storage engine does not support foreign keys, you still will be able to specify them, and they also will be shown on the E-R diagrams.<br><br>
<em>Foreign keys list</em><br>
<br> This list contains the foreign keys that were defined for this table. By clicking on a foreign key you select it and you can delete the selected foreign key with the <img src="remove.png" alt="remove" width="16" height="16">c button. Foreign key propagation is by default not enabled, meaning, a foreign key defined in a parent table usually is not taken over in the specialized table.<br><br>

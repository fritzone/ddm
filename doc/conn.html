<P STYLE="background: white; line-height: 115%"> <span id="myfont"> DDM supports the notion of &quot;Connection&quot; to a database. For you this basically means that you don't have to type in the database details every time you want to <a href="depl.html">deploy</a> something to a machine, but only once, when you create the connection, and from that point the connection is available for future use.<br>
    <br>
  To create a connection click the <img src="new_dbconn.png" width="16" height="16"> button in the application main toolbar and fill in the required details:<br>
  - Name (the name of the connection)<br>
  - Host (the host where this database is located)<br>
  - User/Password (the required authentication data - Warning!!! The Password will be stored in plaintext in the connection configuration file)<br>
  Now, click <strong>Connect</strong>.<br>
  The combo box of databases will be populated with the databases found at the given location. Or you can create a new database by clicking the &quot;<em>+</em>&quot; button. Check the &quot;<em>Auto Connect</em>&quot; checkbox if you want to start this connection every time you start DDM.<br>
  <br>
  From this point your connection is remembered for future use. You have all your connections listed in the Conenction tree (accessible from the &quot;View&quot; menu) where you can either test the connection or delete or modify them.<br>
  <br>
  DDM offers the possibilty to browse the database objects existing in your connections. For more about this please read <a href="brows.html">this</a> document.<br>

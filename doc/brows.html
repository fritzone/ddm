<P STYLE="background: white"><span id="myfont">After you have created your connections you can browse them. To do this, either<br>
  <br>
  1. Right click the connection in the connection tree and select &quot;Connect&quot; then Right click again and select &quot;Browse&quot; (you only can browse a connected connection)<br>
2. Double click the connection in the connection tree, this will automatically connect the connection and starts browsing it.<br>
<br>
After these steps now you are able to see the tables of the connection. If you don't have a solution you just can see the data stored in the table. For this, just double click the table (or right click and choose &quot;Browse table data&quot;). <br>
<br>
If you have a solution you can import a table from the database into your solution, without the need to do a full reverse engineering of the database and you also have the possibilty to add tables from different databases to your solution, and deploy them later.</span><br>

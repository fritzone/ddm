<FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Diagrams can be used by the database designer to provide a visualization of the relations between the tables of the newly created database. On the left of the screen there are the available tables, you can drag and drop them on the big white field on the right. The diagram of the table will appear there. You can move the table on the big white field using the mouse, if you want to remove it from there right click and choose remove. The foreign keys are automatically populated when adding tables that have this kind of relationship between them. You cannot remove foreign keys from the diagram, otherwise it would be invalid. You have the freedom to manually organize the elements on the big white field, so that they fit your needs. In case you prefer, you can save and/or print the diagram using the buttons from the small toolbar above the table list. To be close to a realistic approach of a database,a table can be put on a diagram only once.<br><br>In case you want to add a Note to the diagram drag and drop the note from the list on the left, then edit the text. Notes also can be moved on the field, or remvoed from there.

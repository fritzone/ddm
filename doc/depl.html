        the solution in terms of DDM means to take the generated SQL scripts of
        all the components of the solution, connect to a specific database and
        run the SQL script. This will create the tables, views and foreign keys.
        Deployment can be done by:<br>
        <br>
        - Clicking the "Deploy solution" button <img src="deploy.png" height="16"
          width="16"> in the main toolbar. This will open a dialog box with all
        the connection that are defined and you can select one or more
        connections. DDM will deploy the solution to all the selected databases.<br>
        - Long click the "Deploy solution" button and in the popup menu select
        the database you want this solution to be deployed.<br>
        <br>
        When starting the deployment DDM will update the status bar of the
        application, and when done with the deployment DDM will give a feedback
        about the status of the deployment. In case of deployment errors a
        descriptive message will be presented to the user.<br>
        <br>
        <strong><em>Inject Metadata</em><br>
          <br>
        </strong>By Selecting this option you instruct DDM to inject the
        metadata of the version (ie. the serialized XML into the database where
        the solution was deployed. This will allow other users to bind to the
        specific deployment (this option is given in the <a href="newp.html">New
          Solution</a> screen) and continue the work. Beware! This is not
        synchronized yet and multiple users can connect to the same database
        thus destroying each others work.&nbsp;</font> <br>

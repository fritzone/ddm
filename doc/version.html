DDM has support for version handling in the application since release
0.1j. From the users'
perspective the version handling of DDM can be shortly described as a
sequence of the following steps.<br>
<br>1. When starting a new project the user works on a major version:
1.0.
All the work goes into this version. When he is done with the work and
considers all the objects to be "final" he can "release" the version.
The
released major versions (they conform to the naming convention of X.0)
are supposed to be the ones being deployed to sites, however the user
can choose to deploy any version he finds suitable for deployment.
Releaseing a version is done from the Context menu of the Version, by
choosing "<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Release Version</span></span>".<br>
<br>
2. Releasing a major version (such as 1.0) will create another major
version,
namely "2.0" (or X+1.0 if the user works on version X.0). All the
objects are copied over from version 1.0. All the objects in v1.0 (and
in the tree) are locked into a normal lock stage(in the tree they
change the icon with a yellow lock indicator), they are not available
for further modification unless unlocked in a patch. All the objects in
v2.0 are unlocked, the user can continue working on this major version.
He can change, delete, etc... all the objects he wants. From this point
on all the default operations (those that are triggered from the Main
toolbar or the Menu of the Application) of addition of new objects,
instantiation
of table templates, injection of elements from existing databases will
happen in this version. The user can release V2.0 and this will lead to
V3.0 and so on...<br>
<br>
These simple steps ensure a stable version handling, without too much
hassle and a consistent management of changes between versions.<br>
<br>
The version management feature of DDM is NOT for tracking your daily
changes. It is more suitable to use a version control system (git,
mercurial, svn, ...) for this purpose. The main purpose for it
is to track changes of your database between deliveries, to easily
upgrade already deployed systems and
to manage versions of the same database objects.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>Patching</strong></em><strong></strong><br>
<br>
DDM has support for patching existing versions thus providing support
to already existing deployments. The need for patching comes when in an already deployed version bugs
were identified, however there is no real
business need to upgrade the entire site to a newer version. <br>
<br>
After releasing a version (1.0) this version gets locked in a normal
lock stage (yellow lock icon) meaning the
elements of this version can be patched. This is done like:<br>
<br>- Right click a locked element in v1.0 and select "Unlock". This
will
unlock the element in 1.0 (also will create
a "Patch" object for the version and a new "Patch" window should appear
on the screen with the newly created patch name and the unlocked
element(s) ). <br>
- The user can modify the element or re-lock it (this will revert the
element and remove the copy from the patch).
If there are no more elements in the patch the patch item will be
removed from the gui.<br>
<br>
Deleting elements in released versions conforms to the deletion
procedure in current versions. Users cannot delete
tables which were specialized unless all the specialized tables are
deleted. Users cannot delete tables which are
referenced by foreign keys. When deleting table instances which
instantiated other table instances the automatically
instantiated instances will also be deleted. The user gets visual
feedback in the patch tree, all the elements that
were automatically deleted will appear under the deleted item with the
deletion indicator. Users can undelete
deleted table instances from their context menu in the patch window.
This will restore all the automatically
deleted objects however we cannot guarantee that the order of elements
will be as before deletion.<br>
<br>
When the user is done modifying the locked element he either can:<br>
1. modify more elements (by unlocking them in the tree)<br>
2. <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">R</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">elease</span>
a Minor version by releasing the "Patch", by selecting this option from
the
GUI, Patch window, Patch's context menu. This operation will add a new
major version to to the tree 1.1 right after 1.0. Version 1.0 gets
locked again (in a final lock stage, meaning Red icon in the project
tree and unavailable GUI controls for editing), the user cannot modify
it anymore, all
the further patches must be done on 1.1. <br>
<br>
<strong><em> Version locking</em></strong><br>
<br>
A version in DDM can be in the following lock stages:<br>
<br>
<em>Current version</em>. This version is the one the user by default
works with. All the default actions the user
performs from the main toolbar or the application menu are effective in
the current version. I.e. if the user presses
the new table button (while having other versions with or without
patches) the table will be created in the current
working version. In the project tree the current version is marked with
a standard version icon.
If there are no released versions thetree item is not bold.<br>
<br>
<em>Released version</em>. This is the version the user just released.
The tree indicator has a yellow lock icon with italic text.
The user can create a patch in this version. The user has the
possibilty to add new elements to this version and also delete objects
from this version via a patch.<br>
<br>
<em>Finalized version</em>. This is a version that was patched. The
user cannot modify any element in this version. The GUI indicatior of a
finalized version is a red icon with pale grey italic text. The GUI of
the properties elements in a final version is read only.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update<br>
</span><br>
</span>There is the possibilty to generate update scripts from one version to the another. See <a href="upd.html">this</a> document.<br>

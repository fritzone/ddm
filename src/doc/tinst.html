<font style="font-size: 11pt;" color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">When
working in an object oriented modelling project, the table instances
are being created from a table template:<br>
<br>
- in the project tree right click on the table template, choose
Instantiate, or<br>
- Click the "New Table Instance" tool button and in the new dialog box
check all the table instance you need<br>
- or Long click the "New Table Instance" button and from the popup
select one table instance.<br>
- or click the "Instantiate table" next to the table name in the Table properties window <br>
<br>
The table instance screen can be used to create the startup values of
the tables (ie, values that will be inserted in the tables right after
the creation. There is the possibility to import values from CSV files,
and also you can save the values for further reference into CSV files.
These values will be appended in the table generation SQL script in
form of INSERT INTO ... lines of code. In case your table contains an
AUTO_INCREMENT column (MySQL tables) the GUI will allow you to specify
the values, however the generated SQL script will NOT contain them to
protect the integrity of the data.<br>
<br>
With the <img src="add.png" alt="add" height="16" width="16"> button
you insert a new row in the table, with the <img src="remove.png" alt="remove" height="16" width="16"> button you remove the currently
selected row from the table. When you are done with inserting the data
press the <img src="apply.png" alt="apply" height="16" width="16">


button to validate the data that was entered by you. 
Basic validation is done at this stage, there
are some basic error checkings, such as do not enter a string value for
a numeric field, but the more complex validations are reserverd for
future releases of the application. The data is saved automatically during the input.<br>
<br>
When you are instantiating a table that has a foreign key reference to
another table the other table will be instantiated also, but only if
there are no other instances of that table (I call this phenomenon: one
table pulled in another table in the instantiation), and in the project
tree it will get a specific marking: <img src="tabinstlock.png" height="16" width="16"> ie. the icon of the table instance (<img src="tabinst.png" height="16" width="16">) with a small yellow lock
icon. When you delete a table instance which pulled in other tables
being instantiated will also delete the pulled in tables, and you
cannot delete a pulled in table without deleting the table which pulled
it in.<br>
<br>
For table instances which have a foreign key to another table in the
"Table Instance" window there is a Tab, for specifying to which
table instance the specified foreign keys are mapped. Select the
corresponding table instance. On the deletion or rename of a table instance which
was specified as a foreign key destination in some other table
instance, you will need to specify again the table instance to which
the foreign key will map, otherwise you might not get the desired results in your
deployment script.<br>
<br>
A typical confusion among first time users of the tool is that they
create a table <span style="font-style: italic;">template </span>and
then they expect to see its SQL in the deployment script, however the
SQLs of the tables that are being deployed are created based on the
table <span style="font-style: italic;">instances</span> so always
instantiate a table template when you are done with the layout of the
table.</font><br>

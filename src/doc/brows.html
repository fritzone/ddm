them. To do this, either<br>
<br>
1. Right click the connection in the connection tree and select
"Refresh". This will connect to the database and retrieev all the elements found in it.<br>
<br>
2. Double click the connection in the connection tree, this will
automatically connect the connection and starts browsing it.<br>
<br>
After these steps now you are able to see the tables, views, stored
methods and triggers of the database represented by the selected
connection. If you don't have a solution you just can browse the data
stored in the table. For this, just double click the table (or right
click and choose "Browse table data"). The tool offers a read-only view
to the databse objects, however there is the possibilty for you to run
scripts on the database.<br>
<br>
If you have a solution you can import a table from the database into
your solution, without the need to do a full reverse engineering of the
database and you also have the possibilty to add tables from different
databases to your solution, and deploy them later. At this stage it is
possible to import only tables into the solution.<br>
<br>
<strong>Other options regarding connections</strong><br>
<br>
When you right click a connection you will get a menu where
the followings are the top level options you can choose from:<br>
<br>
<em>Run Query</em><br>
<br>
By selecting this option an SQL editor window bound to the database
specified in this connection will open. In this window you can type in
SQL queries and execute them using <span class="style1">Ctrl+Enter</span>. Selecting this option
automatically connects the database, starts browsing it and shows the
content of the database. When you execute a data definition statement the connection tree is updated with the newly created object (or if you drop something the entry will be removed from the tree).<br>
<br>
<em>Test Connection</em><br>
<br>Selecting this option verifies whether the connection to the
database
is possible or not. This option does not start browsing the connection
(ie: does not populate the tables, views, etc... items in the tree
entry).
If browsing the database connection is possible the icon is updated
with a green
signaller, otherwise it gets updated with a red one.<br>
<br>
</span><span id="myfont"><em>Edit Connection</em><br>
<br>
Will open the window to modify the properties of the connection. This option does not perform operations on the database.<br>
<br>
</span><span id="myfont"><em>Delete</em><br>
<br>
Choosing this option will remove the connection from the list of
available connections, this does not affect the physical database.<em></em><br>
<em><br>
Refresh</em><br>
<br>
Choosing this option will refresh the tree objects of the database (ie: clear the tree, connect to the database, fetch all the items again and populate the tree again).<em></em><br>
<br>
The <strong>&quot;New...&quot; </strong>top level menu entry is available for all databases. Contains:<br>
<br>
<em>New Table<br>
<br>
</em>You can create a new table in this connection.<br>
<br>
The <strong>&quot;Database&quot;</strong> top level menu item with the following entries is visible only for MySql databases:<br>
<br>
<em></em><em>Recreate</em><br>
<br>
Choosing this option will execute a "<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">DROP
DATABASE</span>" and "<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">CREATE
DATABASE</span>" script for the database represented by the given
connection. This will remove all the objects from the database!<br>
<br>
<em></em><em>Drop</em><br>
<br>
Choosing this option will execute a "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DROP DATABASE</span>" on the given
connection.</span><br>
<br>

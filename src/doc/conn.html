<P STYLE="background: white; line-height: 115%"> <span id="myfont"> DDM supports the notion of &quot;Connection&quot; to a database. For you this basically means that you don't have to type in the database details every time you want to <a href="depl.html">deploy</a> something to a machine, but only once, when you create the connection, and from that point the connection is available for future use.<br>
    <br>
  To create a connection click the <img src="new_dbconn.png" width="16" height="16"> button in the application main toolbar (or in the Connection tree) and fill in the required details. You can specify the database from the &quot;Database Type&quot; combobox.<br>
  <br>
  Some controls,  are common to all the databases. These are the following: <br>
  <br>
-  &quot;<em>Name</em>&quot; of the connection - either give a proper name, or let DDM generate one for you<br>
- 
&quot;<em>Auto Connect</em>&quot;. Check the &quot;<em>Auto Connect</em>&quot; checkbox if you want to start this connection every time you start DDM.<br>
-  &quot;<em>Save Password</em>&quot; is a disabled checkbox reminding yo all the time that the password will be stored in plaintext in the connection configuration file.<br>
<br>
  The connection details vary for each of the different databases DDM supports.<br>
  <br>
  For <strong>MySql</strong> they are the following<br>
  <br>
  - &quot;<em>Host</em>&quot; - the host where this database is located. Type in the IP or the hostname<br>
  - The &quot;<em>Port</em>&quot; on which the mysql daemon is listening. The MySql default is 3306 but this might vary<br>
  - &quot;<em>User</em>&quot; / &quot;<em>Password</em>&quot; the required authentication data.<br>
  <br>
  Now, click <em>the &quot;Connect</em>&quot; button.<br>
  <br>
  The combo box of databases will be populated with the databases found at the given location. Or you can create a new database by clicking the &quot;<em>+</em>&quot; button. <br>
  <br>
  For <strong>Sqlite</strong> the following controls are relevant:<br>
  <br>
  - The &quot;<em>Version</em>&quot;. DDM (via Qt) supports both version 2 and 3. Select the one you want.<br>
  - The &quot;<em>Database</em>&quot; entry is the file name where the Sqlite database is located. Either type in the name or use the &quot;<em>Browse</em>&quot; (yellow folder) button to open an existing one.<br>
  <br>
  For <strong>CUBRID</strong> the following controls are meaningful:<br>
  <br>
- &quot;<em>Host</em>&quot; - the host where this database is located. Type in the IP or the hostname<br>
- The &quot;<em>Port</em>&quot; on which the mysql daemon is listening. The CUBRID default port is 30000 but this might vary depending on the installation<br>
- &quot;<em>User</em>&quot; / &quot;<em>Password</em>&quot; the required authentication data.<br>
- In the &quot;<em>Database</em>&quot; field type in the name of the database and press &quot;<em>Test Connection</em>&quot; in order to see if it is valid or not. By pressing this button you will also get a list of available databases on that server.<br>
<br>
Once you have populated all the required database fields you can save it by pressing the &quot;<em>Ok</em>&quot; button. From this point your connection is remembered for future use. You have all your connections listed in the Conenction tree (accessible from the &quot;View&quot; menu) where you can either test the connection or delete or modify them.<br>

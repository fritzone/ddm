DDM supports the notion of "Connection" to a database. For you this
basically means that you don't have to type in the database details
every time you want to <a href="depl.html">deploy</a> something to a
machine, but only once, when you create the connection, and from that
point the connection is available for future use.<br>
    <br>
  To create a connection click the <img src="new_dbconn.png" height="16" width="16">
button in the application main toolbar (or in the Connection tree) and
fill in the required details. You can specify the database from the
"Database Type" combobox.<br>
  <br>
  Some controls,  are common to all the databases. These are the following: <br>
  <br>
-  "<em>Name</em>" of the connection - either give a proper name, or let DDM generate one for you<br>
- 
"<em>Auto Connect</em>". Check the "<em>Auto Connect</em>" checkbox if you want to start this connection every time you start DDM.<br>
-  "<em>Save Password</em>"
is a disabled checkbox reminding yo all the time that the password will
be stored in plaintext in the connection configuration file.<br>
<br>
  The connection details vary for each of the different databases DDM supports.<br>
  <br>
  For <strong>MySql</strong> they are the following<br>
  <br>
  - "<em>Host</em>" - the host where this database is located. Type in the IP or the hostname<br>
  - The "<em>Port</em>" on which the mysql daemon is listening. The MySql default is 3306 but this might vary<br>
  - "<em>User</em>" / "<em>Password</em>" the required authentication data.<br>
  <br>
  Now, click <em>the "Connect</em>" button.<br>
  <br>
The combo box of databases will be populated with the databases found
at the given location. Or you can create a new database by clicking the
"<em>+</em>" button. <br>
  <br>
  For <strong>Sqlite</strong> the following controls are relevant:<br>
  <br>
  - The "<em>Version</em>". DDM (via Qt) supports both version 2 and 3. Select the one you want.<br>
  - The "<em>Database</em>" entry is the file name where the Sqlite database is located. Either type in the name or use the "<em>Browse</em>" (yellow folder) button to open an existing one.<br>
  <br>
  For <strong>CUBRID</strong> the following controls are meaningful:<br>
  <br>
- "<em>Host</em>" - the host where this database is located. Type in the IP or the hostname<br>
- The "<em>Port</em>" on which the mysql daemon is listening. The CUBRID default port is 30000 but this might vary depending on the installation<br>
- "<em>User</em>" / "<em>Password</em>" the required authentication data.<br>
- In the "<em>Database</em>" field type in the name of the database and press "<em>Test Connection</em>" in order to see if it is valid or not. By pressing this button you will also get a list of available databases on that server.<br>
<br>
Once you have populated all the required database fields you can save it by pressing the "<em>Ok</em>"
button. From this point your connection is remembered for future use.
You have all your connections listed in the Conenction tree (accessible
from the "View" menu) where you can either <a href="brows.html">test</a> the connection or delete or modify them.<br>
